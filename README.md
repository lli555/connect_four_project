The Connect4 Robot Arm project combines mechanical and software engineering to give the robot the ability to  analyze and play optimally against a human player.
## Mission of the Project
The goal of this project is to gear towards the understanding of AI and robotics, 
which provides insights into how robotics and computer science can solve more complex problems and perform high-intellect tasks. 
The experience and techniques gained from this project are also preparations for manipulation of more advanced and intellectual AI robots.
